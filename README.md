# Python-Programming-MOOC-2022

Uploaded this just as a memory of my first game.
Made with pygame as a part of Advanced Course in Programming in University of Helsinki online course.

Pygame needs to be installed locally for the game to work. 
'pip install pygame' on the command prompt should do the trick.

This game was well received by the audience.
  - Dad, this game is fun!
